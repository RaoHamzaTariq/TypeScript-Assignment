//  The Question no.26 is:

// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Answer:

let alien_color : string = 'green';

if(alien_color == 'green'){
    console.log("The Players just earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
}else{
    console.log('The Player just earned 10 points')
}
let alien_color_block : string = 'red'; 

if(alien_color_block == 'green'){
    console.log("The Players just earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
}else{
    console.log('The Player just earned 10 points')
}
