//  The Question no.44 is:
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
// Answer:
function car_information(manufacturer, model_name, color, fuel_consumption, engine_cc, doors, auto) {
    var car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model_name: model_name,
        color: color,
        fuel_consumption: fuel_consumption,
        engine_cc: engine_cc,
        doors: doors,
        auto: auto
    };
    return car;
}
console.log(car_information('Suzuki', 'Alto 2011', 'White', 10, 1000, 4, false));
