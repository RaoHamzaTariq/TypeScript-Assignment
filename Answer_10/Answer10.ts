/// The Tenth Question is:

// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

/// Answer:

/// First, I am choosing the program no.6 (Eight number) ////

// For Addition:
let Addition : number = 4+4;

// For Subtraction:
let Subtraction : number = 16-8;

// For Multiplication:
let Multiplication : number = 4*2;

// For Division:
let Division : number = 16/2

// Display the Addition
console.log(Addition);

// Display the Subtraction
console.log(Subtraction);

// Display the Multiplication
console.log(Multiplication);

// Display the Division
console.log(Division);

/// Second, I am choosing the program no. 9 (Favorite Number) ////

// I am creating variable "fav_num" in which i stored my favourite number
let fav_num : number = 3
// Now Display the message:
console.log(`My favourite Number is: ${fav_num}`);
