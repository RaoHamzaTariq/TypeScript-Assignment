/// The Tenth Question is:
// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
/// Answer:
/// First, I am choosing the program no.6 (Eight number) ////
// For Addition:
var Addition = 4 + 4;
// For Subtraction:
var Subtraction = 16 - 8;
// For Multiplication:
var Multiplication = 4 * 2;
// For Division:
var Division = 16 / 2;
// Display the Addition
console.log(Addition);
// Display the Subtraction
console.log(Subtraction);
// Display the Multiplication
console.log(Multiplication);
// Display the Division
console.log(Division);
/// Second, I am choosing the program no. 9 (Favorite Number) ////
